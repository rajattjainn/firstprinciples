1. Embedding
    1. Convert the input sentence to a number vector --> each word correspond to the index of that word in the vocabulary.
    2. Convert the vector into embeddings.
    3. What is d_model ? <br>
        A: Dimension of the vector output at each layer and at the embedding layer. 
    4. What do we mean by Dropout ? <br>
        A: A regularization technique to avoid overfitting. The idea is to randomly ignore a proportion of neurons during training process. 
    5. What is regularization? <br>
        A: Regularization is a technique to avoid overfitting in the data.<br>
        **[ToDo]**: Read more about regularization and overfitting.<br>
        Following up Questions:<br>
            1. In which layer, is regularisation/dropout applied ?
    6. Use of -> while defining a python function ?<br>
        A: Defines the return type of the function.
    7. Calculations in positionalencoding class's init function ? <br>
